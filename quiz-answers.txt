AJAX Basics
1.  AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript & XML.
2.  AJAX lets you update content on a webpage without loading a new webpage.
3.  When a server answers an AJAX request, it sends back a response.
4.  You use AJAX to communicate with a server by sending it a request.

How AJAX Works
1.  Callbacks for multiple AJAX requests may not run in the order the requests
    were sent.
2.  The browser uses XMLHttpRequest Objects to manage AJAX requests.
3.  The four steps to creating an AJAX request are:
      1.  Create a XMLHttpRequest Object.
      2.  Create a callback function.
      3.  Open request.
      4.  Send request.
