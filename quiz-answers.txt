AJAX Basics
1.  AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript & XML.
2.  AJAX lets you update content on a webpage without loading a new webpage.
3.  When a server answers an AJAX request, it sends back a response.
4.  You use AJAX to communicate with a server by sending it a request.


How AJAX Works
1.  Callbacks for multiple AJAX requests may not run in the order the requests
    were sent.
2.  The browser uses XMLHttpRequest Objects to manage AJAX requests.
3.  The four steps to creating an AJAX request are:
      1.  Create a XMLHttpRequest Object.
      2.  Create a callback function.
      3.  Open request.
      4.  Send request.


HTTP Request Methods
1.  When should you use the POST HTTP method with AJAX?
A.  When you want to send data that the web server should store in a database and
    When you want to send more than 2083 characters of data to the web server.

2.  Which of these is an example of a valid query string?
    http://server.com/page.php?name=Johnny+Depp&movie=Pirates+of+the+Caribbean%3A+Dead+Man%27s+Chest

3.  What is a common reason for using the GET HTTP Method to send an AJAX request?
    When you're only interested in getting information from a web server.

4.  What is a query string?
    Information sent to the web server. It is added to the end of a URL.

5.  Which of these is a difference between GET and POST?
    POST sends its data in the "body" of the request. GET sends data in the URL.


AJAX Response Formats
1.  What does XML stand for?
    Extensible Markup Language.

2.  True or False: HTML and XML both use tags to mark up information.
    True.

3.  Which of these is NOT a common AJAX response format?
    Binary Files. You can receive binary files -- like images -- using AJAX, but
    plain text formats like JSON, XML, and HTML are more common.

4.  True or False: XML is the preferred format for AJAX responses because XML is the easiest format for JavaScript to work with.
    False. JSON is a much better data exchange format for JavaScript.


AJAX Security Limitations
1.  True or False: When adding standard AJAX requests to your pages, you need to view that page through a web server in order to preview the results.
    True.

2.  Imagine you have a web page that is retrieved from http://www.myserver.com. Which of the following scenarios is NOT against a web browser's same-origin policy?
    None of the above.

3.  Why is a web proxy useful for AJAX requests?
    It allows you to bypass a web browser's same-origin policy by retrieving data
    from another server, while keeping AJAX requests within the same domain.

4.  What does CORS stand for?
    Cross-origin resource sharing.

5.  What does JSONP stand for?
    JSON with Padding.
